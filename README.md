## Linked-List

#### Specification
Now it’s time to try your hand at building a small application.

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:

Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark
